# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation
A Java simulation of popular CPU scheduling algorithms using an analogy of a Andre the Barman (The CPU) serving bar patrons (jobs)

## The following algorithms can be simulated:
First Come First Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)

### To run the simulation, run the following command in the directory of the Makefile

```bash
  > make run ARGS="<num_patrons> <0/1/2, 0=FCFS 1=SJF 2=RR">
```

#### For example, to run a SJF simulation for 10 patrons:

```bash
  > make run ARGS="10 1">
```
